# CrisisCore Systems

> Developing Protective Computing — an engineering discipline for safety-critical, vulnerability-aware software.

CrisisCore Systems is the home of work on the
**Overton Framework** and related systems,
focused on designing software that remains safe,
meaningful, and reversible under real-world
conditions of instability, crisis, and human vulnerability.

## 🧭 Positioning

Protective Computing applies when:

- Connectivity cannot be assumed  
- Users are under stress or crisis  
- Safety and autonomy matter  
- Exposure must be minimized

It prioritizes:
✔ Local authority  
✔ Minimal unnecessary exposure  
✔ Reversibility  
✔ Cognitive load preservation  
✔ Coercion resistance
