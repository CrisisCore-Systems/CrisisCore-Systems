## 🧠 Collapse Intelligence Doctrine

I analyze systems as if they are organisms — not lines of code, but breathing architectures with oracles as pulse, liquidity as blood, and upgrades as neurological trauma. My work targets **recursive entropy**, **temporal desync**, **arithmetic decay**, and **permission residue**.

I don’t find bugs. I reveal **collapse vectors** — points of inevitable failure across protocol time, yield recursion, and state drift.

### Primary Threat Classes

* 🧠 **Temporal Desynchronization** — Epoch drift, oracle lag, delayed reward syncs
* 🔁 **Recursive Feedback Amplification** — Vault wrapping, compounding derivatives
* 🧼 **Permission Residue & Ghost States** — Proxy upgrades, storage slot hauntings
* 🧮 **Arithmetic Fragility** — Precision collapse, rounding drift, delta loops
* 📉 **Vault Share Divergence** — Donation-based manipulation, slippage floor gaps
