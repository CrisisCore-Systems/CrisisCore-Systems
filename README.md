  <strong>I build the tools I needed when the system decided I was disposable.</strong><br>
  Offline-first. Trauma-aware. Zero-cloud. Open-source.<br>
  Because some of us don’t get to code from a stable address.

### The Operating Environment
Unhoused in British Columbia. On PWD income assistance.  
I code from weekly motels that eat the entire cheque, from library terminals that shut off at 8 pm, from the back of borrowed cars when there is nowhere else.

Everything here is built to survive those conditions — and to protect anyone else living in them.

### PainTracker.ca — The Flagship
The chronic-pain & injury journal that refuses to sell your crisis.

- Full clinical assessments (7-step, 25+ body regions, nerve & QoL metrics)  
- Interactive heat-maps, longitudinal trends, treatment-effect overlays  
- WorkSafeBC-ready reports + structured CSV/JSON for clinicians  
- **100 % local storage** — encrypted, offline-first, no backend, no telemetry  
- Runs on $100 Android phones and decade-old laptops because I test on what I can afford

### Next 90-Day Hard Commitments (if I still have power)
1. Analytics v2 – comparative heat-maps + treatment overlays  
2. Clinician Export Pack – printable visit summaries + structured data  
3. Full a11y suite – keyboard navigation, high-contrast, reader paths  
4. Encrypted local backups + seamless import/restore  
5. Template library – WorkSafeBC variants, ICBC, private-clinic presets  

All shipped audited, zero-cloud, open-source.

### Security Is the Only Luxury I Can Guarantee
- No cloud by default · no analytics · no third-party anything  
- Zod-typed boundaries · strict CSP · sanitized every flow  
- CodeQL + SAST in CI · weekly dependency audits · OpenSSF Scorecard >700  
- Critical health & security fixes are **never** paywalled

### How to Keep the Lights On (and the Code Shipping)
I have no investors, no safety net, no address that lasts more than 30 days.
